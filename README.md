# Heart-Detection-Using-Fuzzy-Logic
This repository contains resources for implementing a heart detection system using fuzzy logic. The project includes analysis using machine learning models (random forest and decision tree), defining membership functions for variables, designing a fuzzy system, and reading/interpreting a fuzzy rule base.

# Contents
1. Code: This folder contains a Python notebook (heart_detection_.ipynb) where you can find the implementation of the heart detection system. It includes sections for ML model analysis, defining membership functions, designing the fuzzy system, and reading/interpreting the fuzzy rule base.

2. Report and Presentation Slides: This folder contains the project report (Report.pdf) detailing the methodology, findings, and conclusions of the heart detection system. Additionally, presentation slides (Presentation_Slides.pdf) are provided for a concise overview of the project.

3. Datasets: This folder contains the datasets used in the project. The datasets are sourced from the Heart Detection CSV available in the UCI Repository.

# Usage
1. Code: Open and run the Python notebook Heart_Disease_Detection_using_Fuzzy_Logic.ipynb in the Code folder. Follow the instructions and comments within the notebook for guidance on analysing the dataset, implementing machine learning models, defining membership functions, designing the fuzzy system, and interpreting the fuzzy rule base.

2. Report and Presentation Slides: Refer to Project_Report.pdf for a detailed understanding of the project methodology, results, and conclusions. For a brief overview, consult Heart_Disease_Detection_Using_Fuzzy_Logic.pdf.

3. Datasets: Access the datasets from the Datasets folder. These datasets are used for training and testing the heart detection system.
